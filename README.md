hSDK
====
hSDK is an Extension SDK for Multimedia Fusion 2.0 and ClickTeam Fusion 2.5 which allows high-level development by abstracting the low-level interface to Fusion. Runtime abstraction is made efficient by template metaprograms that generate as little as possible runtime overhead.

Make sure you are using the latest version of Microsoft Visual Studio, as older versions do not support the modern C++11/14 features that are in use.
