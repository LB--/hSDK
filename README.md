hSDK
====
hSDK is an Extension SDK for Multimedia Fusion 2 and ClickTeam Fusion 2.5 which allows high-level development by abstracting the low-level interface to Fusion. Runtime abstraction is made efficient by template metaprograms that generate as little as possible runtime overhead.

To build extensions with hSDK, you must have a compiler that supports at least C++11 and can target 32-bit Windows DLLs. MinGW is recommended, and pre-built MMF2-LibBridge libraries for MinGW are included.
